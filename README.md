# PSY6422-Final-Project
My final project for PSY6422

This project is a collection maps built of the united states of america, showing the number of bachelors degrees people hold in each state by sex and type of degree.

The maps are interactive where you can hover over and see each individual states data about their degree holders. The data will be distributed and visualised by a colour gradient scheme with a scale bar representing the number of people.
